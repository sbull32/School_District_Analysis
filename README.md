# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine what changes to our district and school summary analysis occurred when we updated Thomas High School's 9th grade students math and reading scores with N/A. There was a question with the validity of these students math and reading scores.
